# Developer visibility

In traditional environment, it can be difficult for everyone to get access to a production system to troubleshoot when something goes wrong (not have permission)

That may be due to security concerns, or simply due to the fact that when something goes wrong, the first priority is to fix as quickly as possible, not to find out why it happened

Anyone in the organization that does not have direct access to a production system has no idea why code may or may not be working in production.

This leads to the constants refrain "Well, it works on my machine!"

With containers, the container is the production environment. This mean that anyone can spin up an environment that is exactly like production, even on their own laptop

Developers (and others) have ability to test their code and see exactly how it will behave in production.

The additional visibility offered by containers can help your organization develop and troubleshoot code much more efficiently.
