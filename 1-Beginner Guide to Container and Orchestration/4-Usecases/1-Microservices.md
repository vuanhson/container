# Microservices

## Microservices
Microservices are a type of application architecture that involves splitting the application into a series of small, independent services.

Microservices can be built, modified and scaled separately, with relatively litte impact on one another

## Container and Microservices
Containers excel when it comes to managing a large number of small, independent workloads.

Containers and orchestration make it easier to manage and automate the process of deploying, scaling, and connecting lots of microservice instance

For example, I may have one microservice that needs additional resources. With containers, all I need to do is create more containers for that service to handle the load. With orchestration, that can even be done automatically and in realtime!
