The cloud can be an ambiguous term, but it usually just means "someone else's computer"

Typically this mean that you pay a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), or Google (GCP), and they provide you with servers and resources with which to run your software

The term cloud can also refer to running software in your own datacenter using the tools and practices that are associated with the cloud. This is sometimes called Private Cloud

There are many ways to run software in the cloud. This includes running containers on servers hosted by a cloud provider

Doing containers in the cloud simply means that you are running containers on the server in the cloud

Most cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform provide services which are specifically designed around containers, offering you the ability to run containers in the cloud quick and easily.
