# The benefits of containers in the cloud

Containers are just one way to run software in the cloud, not the only one.

Some of the benefits of using containers in the cloud are:

- **Regular Benefits of containers**: You get all the normal benefits of containers in terms of portability, speed and ease of automation
- **Save money**: Since containers are lightweight and have little overhead, they can help save on cloud costs. With cloud providers, you only pay for the resources you use. Use less resources, pay less
- **Cloud platform offer container support out of the box**: Most cloud platforms provide services built specifically for containers.
