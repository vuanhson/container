# Advantages and Limitations of Containers

Advantages:
- The isolation and portability of VMs
- More lightweight than VMs - Less resource usage.
- Faster than VMs - containers can start up in seconds, not minutes.
- Smaller than VMs - Container images can be measured in Megabytes, not Gigabytes
- All of these add up to faster and simpler automation

Limitations:
- Less flexibility than VMs - You can't run a Windows container on a Linux Machine (yet)
- Introduces new challenges around orchestration and automation
