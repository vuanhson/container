# What are Containers

Containers are all about **portable** software

They are technology that allow you to run software on a variety of systems, including a developer's laptop, all the way to a production system.

This speeds up deployments, simplifies automation, and ensures your code can run consistently in production, as well as everywhere else.

Like virtual machines, containers wrap your software in a standardized environment, allow it to run consistently on varied machines.
