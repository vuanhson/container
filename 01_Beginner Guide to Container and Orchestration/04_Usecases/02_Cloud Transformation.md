# Cloud Transformation

Cloud transformation is the process to migrating your existing IT infrastructure to the cloud

Many companies today are making the transition away from locally-hosted services and toward services hosted in the cloud

However moving your infrastructure into the cloud can come with challenges 

## Container and cloud transformation
Containers can help you move into the cloud. It is relatively easy to warp existing software in containers. While container may not be the answer for every type of existing software, they are powerful tool.

Using containers in the cloud to run your software can allow you to take advantage of flexibility and automatability of containers.

Since containers use fewer resources than virtual machines, you can save money on cloud resources!
